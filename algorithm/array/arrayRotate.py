# leftRotate(arr[], d, n)
# start
#   For i = 0 to i < d
#     Left rotate all elements of arr[] by one
# end
# To rotate by one, store arr[0] in a temporary variable temp, move arr[1] to arr[0], arr[2] to arr[1] â€¦and finally temp to arr[n-1]

# Let us take the same example arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2
# Rotate arr[] by one 2 times
# We get [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1] after first rotation and [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2] after second rotation.

# Python3 program to rotate an array by  
# d elements  
# Function to left rotate arr[] of size n by d*/
