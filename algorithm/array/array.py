# Lists in Python 
# Lists are one of the most powerful tools in python. They are just like the arrays declared in other languages.
#  But the most powerful thing is that list need not be always homogeneous. A single list can contain strings,
#   integers, as well as objects. Lists can also be used for implementing stacks and queues.
#  Lists are mutable, i.e., they can be altered once declared.
# Declaring a list 
L = [1, "a" , "string" , 1+2] 
print (L) 
L.append(6) 
print (L) 
L.pop() 
print (L) 
print (L[1])
